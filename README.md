This is a Recipe app to store recipes and create grocery lists using those apps.
Eventually it will be an app that is available on iOS, Mac, Apple Watch and also have widgets. Am beginning with the iOS focus.

The backend uses Cloudkit, and is currently being used with iOS 15.0 to test the new async/await functionality
